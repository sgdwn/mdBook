## Mass Spectroscopy  
### Time of Flight  
- Measures time taken for particles to move from one end to the other  
- All particles have the same kinetic energy  
- Electron Impact Ionisation  
	o Vaporised to gas   
	o Sprayed past electron gun – electron knocked off – 1+ ion formed  
	o Accelerated into flight tube with negative plates  
- Electrospray Ionisation  
	o Dissolve sample into volatile solvent  
	o Hypodermic needle – high voltage power supply  
	o Adds proton – 1+ charge  
	o Mist as sample leaves needle – accelerated with negative plates  
- Fragmentation  
	o More likely with electron impact  
	o Virtually impossible with electrospray ionisation  
- Larger particles – lower speed / higher mass  
- Smaller particles – higher speed / lower mass  
  
### Calculations  
- 𝐾𝐸 = 12𝑚𝑣^2 positive ions all have the same kinetic energy  
- 𝑣=√2𝐾𝐸𝑚 velocity of a particle  
- 𝑡=𝑑𝑡 and 𝑡=𝑑√𝑚2𝐾𝐸 time of flight in the flight tube  

## Electron Configuration
### Orbitals
- 4 types:
- s Orbitals
	o Spherical shape around nucleus; 1s, 2s, 3s, …; max. 2 electrons
- p Orbitals
	o up to 6 electrons, in 3 shells; 1p, 2p, 3p, …
- d Orbitals
	o up to 10 electrons, in 5 shells; 1d, 2d, 3d, …
- f Orbitals
	o up to 14 electrons, in 7 shells; 1f, 2f, 3f, …
- Orbitals – the area that electrons are likely to be found for that atom

## Ionisation Energy
- The amount of energy required to remove 1 mole of electrons from 1 mole of an atom
- General increase across a period
- Decrease in first ionisation energy down a group (as electrons get further away)
- Decrease between group 2 and 3
	o Outmost electron in p-Orbital, not s-Orbital; more easily lost
- Decrease between group 5 and 6
	o Final electron goes in to ½-filled p-Orbital, so first-time electrons go in to same sub-shell

## Successive Ionisation Energy
- 1st Ionisation Energy
	o Energy required to remove 1 mole of electrons from 1 mole of uncharged element
	o x(g)→x(g)++e(-)
- 2nd Ionisation Energy
	o Energy required to remove 2nd mole of electrons from 1 mole of 1+ ions
	o x(g)1+→x(g)2++e(-)
- 3rd ionisation energy
	o Energy required to remove 3rd mole of electrons from 1 mole of 2+ ions
	o x(g)2+→x(g)3++e(-)
