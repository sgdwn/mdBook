## Empirical Formula  
- The simplest whole number ratio of the atoms in each element present  
- Ethene = C2H6 Ethene (empirical formula) = CH3  
- Empirical formula is always given for ionic compounds, metals, and giant molecules  
	o The actual number of atoms in these compounds is massive  
- Calculating empirical formula  
	o MRDDsF – Mass; Relative mass; Divide 𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠/𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠; Divide by smallest no. of moles; Write formula  
  
## Reacting Masses  
- Percentage Yield  
	o (𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡/𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠)× 100 = 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑦𝑖𝑒𝑙𝑑  
	o Reasons for not getting 100% yield  
		▪ Unwanted side reactions  
		▪ Lost products  
		▪ Incomplete reactions  
		▪ Impure starting materials  
- Atom Economy  
	o 𝑠𝑢𝑚 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑀𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑓𝑢𝑙 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑠/𝑠𝑢𝑚 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑀𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑠 × 100 = 𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑚 𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑦  
	o Gives the efficiency of the reaction – if only 30% of products are useful, atom economy is 30%; if everything was used, atom economy would be 100%  

## Mole Calculations  
WIP  

## Gas Volumes /// Ideal Gas Equation  
- 1 mole of any gas takes up 24dm-3 at standard temperature and pressure  
	o Standard temperature – 25C / 298K  
	o Standard pressure – 1 ATM / 101325 pascals / 100 kPa  
- Ideal Gas Equation  
	o 𝑝𝑉 = 𝑛𝑅𝑇  
	o Pressure, volume, no. of moles, ideal gas constant, temperature (K)  
	o To convert C to K: add 273 to Celsius value  

## Standard Solutions  
- A solution with a known concentration  
- Made by diluting a compound of known concentration and mass in a known amount of water  
- Solute must be:  
	o Easy to prepare, purify, and keep
	o Not hygroscopic, deliquescent, or efflorescent
	o Readily soluble in water
	o High relative molecular mass (minimise weighing errors)
	o Not affected by sunlight / air in solution
### Making a standard solution
	o Weigh mass of solute
	o Add solute to beaker
	o Dissolve solute until colourless – distilled water
	o Pour solution into volumetric flask
	o Rinse beaker, funnel, glass rod
	o Add distilled water to below the line
	o Use dropping pipette to bring level to just below the line
	o Invert the flask (with lid on) – ensure solute is completely dissolved
	o Add distilled water drop by drop to the line

## Titration
- Using one solution of known concentration to calculate concentration of another solution
### Doing a titration:
	o Rinse burette + conical flask – distilled water
	o Rinse burette with acid
	o Close tap, fill burette above line, let excess acid out to get base of meniscus on the line
	o Pipette 110 volume of standard solution into conical flask
	o Add few drops of indicator to conical flask – same amount each time
	o Conical flask under jet of burette – carry out 1 rough titration
	o Carry out 3+ accurate (within 0.10cm3) titrations
### Rinsing apparatus
	o Acid – rinse with water
	o Alkali – HCl, then water
	o Potassium Manganate (VII) solution – water
### Reasons to not get completely concordant results
	o Solutions are not completely mixed
	o Indicator amount is not consistent
	o Gaseous products are in the solution
	o Reaction is slow – indicator changes too late
	o Wrong measurements – pipette
	o Misjudged endpoint

𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (𝑀) = 𝑚𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑠/𝑑𝑚3 1𝑑𝑚3=1𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑒 = 1000𝑐𝑚3

### Back titration
- Reactant A, of unknown concentration, is reacted with excess of reactant B, of known concentration Titration then performed, to work out how much of reactant B is in excess
